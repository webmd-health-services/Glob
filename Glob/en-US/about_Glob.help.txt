DESCRIPTION
    Glob is a PowerShell module that lets you find files using advanced glob 
    syntax. It gives you greater control over files returned in recursive 
    searches. You can use the standard `*`, `?`, and `[]` wildcard operators 
    to match file/directory names. You can also use the `**` operator to 
    match multiple directory names.
    
    For example, the pattern `**\*.ps1` would return all `*.ps1` files in the 
    current and all sub-directories.

    Glob only exposes one function: `Find-GlobFile`. Once you've installed 
    and loaded the Glob module, run `help Find-GlobFile` for more information 
    and examples.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    * Windows PowerShell 4+ running under .NET Framework 4.6 or later
    * PowerShell Core 6+ running under .NET Core.

    Glob is published to the PowerShell Gallery. To install globally:
    
        Install-Module Glob

    [releases area on the Glob GitHub project](https://github.com/webmd-health-services/Glob/releases).


USING

    If you've installed Glob globally, you can run `help Find-GlobFile`.
    
    If you've saved Glob locally, import it, then use `Find-GlobFile`:
    
        # Assumes you've saved the module to `PSModules`
        Import-Module '.\PSModules\Glob'
        help Find-GlobFile
